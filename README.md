# Interview

Task Description:
Your task is to create a responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
that displays a list of blog posts. Each blog post should include a title, a short
description, and a "Read More" link.
The data for the blog posts should be stored in a JavaScript array of objects,
where each object represents a blog post and includes properties for the title
and description.
The "Read More" link doesn't need to lead to an actual blog post, but when
clicked, it should display an alert box with the full description of the
corresponding blog post.
Requirements:
1. Create an HTML file for the structure of the webpage.
2. Style the webpage using CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive.
3. Use JavaScript to dynamically generate the list of blog posts from the
array of objects.
4. Implement functionality for the "Read More" link to display an alert box
with the full description of the blog post.
5. Ensure that the code is well-structured, efficient, and properly
commented.
6. Provide a brief explanation of the logic behind your solution, including any
design choices and assumptions made.
Upon completion of the task, please submit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files,
along with your explanation of the logic behind your solution. We will assess
your work based on code quality, responsiveness of the design, functionality of
the JavaScript, and your ability to clearly explain your thought process. Good
luck!
